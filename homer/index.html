        <p>This is my wonderful ghost that I put lots of time and effort into! It features the character Homer Simpson!</p>

<p>In this ghost, you work alongside Homer at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. Homer talks about random stuff, and you can feed Homer donuts by double-clicking his mouth, and pet his head by moving your mouse or scrolling the mouse wheel over it. But don't double-click his top strands of hair or his eyes...</p>

<p>Homer will also give you ideas to combat boredom if you double-click on him to use his menu, and ask you questions, and you can hug him from the menu. If you double-click the donut, you'll find minigames, but currently there's only one: Word Search. There is also a continuous petting minigame though, so you might find out how long you can pet Homer. There's a dressup option: a donut sticker you can apply to Homer's shirt. I'm also planning to add a music player to him later.</p>

<p>Homer has soundbites, but you can always turn 'em off by going to Ghost Preferences and turning off the Play Sound option for him.</p>

<p>Hope you enjoy!</p>

        <p>He gets your name, pronouns, and birthday from SSP Preferences. He uses my <a href="../misc/index.html">Sky Balloon</a>!</p>

        <h1 id="faq">What's an Ukagaka/ghost?</h1>
		<p>An Ukagaka, or ghost, is a character that hangs out on your desktop! They can do little tasks for you such as emptying your recycling bin, checking for new emails, or checking the weather. Mostly they'll just keep you company and say random dialogue.</p>
		
		<p>Ghosts are very diverse, some have a strong focus on story and discovering information, while others are full of interesting functions or games. Check out this video to learn more!</p>

		<h1 id="faq">How to install a ghost</h1>
        <p>To use a ghost, you'll need a program to run it in. If you're on Windows, you can use <a href="http://ssp.shillest.net/">SSP</a>. If you're not on a Windows computer there are some options available, but you'll have to play around and see what works for you.</p><p>Mac: <a href="https://www14.big.or.jp/~ayase/ese/">Ukagaka on Macs</a>, <a href="http://ccm.sherry.jp/ninni/index.en.html">NiseRingo</a>, <a href="http://tablesalt.o0o0.jp/ukagaka/ct_maconssp.html">PlayonMac+SSP</a>, <a href="https://winebottler.kronenberg.org/">WineBottler</a><br>Linux: <a href="http://ninix-aya.osdn.jp/">NINIX-AYA</a></p>

        <p>For me (OdieDogXP), SSP works almost perfectly on my Arch Linux installation with Wine, with the only caveats being that installing ghosts basically doesn't work unless the file doesn't look <a href="img/UnzipNarLinux.png" target="blank">like this</a> on the inside, or is a simple zip file, and that ghosts only play sound if it's an MP3 file, even with LAV Filters installed.</p>
		
        <p>For those using SSP, go ahead and download the complete install package from the website. When you run it a catgirl named Emily should appear and say something in japanese. Drag and drop the .nar file you downloaded for this ghost on her, and she should install them for you. Once she's done, right click her, hover over 'change ghost', and select the appropriate ghost!</p>
		
        <p>If you get an error window <a href="img/error_nothing_in_directory.png" target="blank">like this</a> when you start SSP, it probably can't find any ghosts to run. You can try dropping the .nar file for the ghost you want to install onto that window. If that doesn't work, click the first button and point it towards your ghost directory (it should be \SSP\ghost).</p>
		
		<p>If the right click menu is in Japanese, the language option is the 4th one up from the bottom. Select English and it should change immediately. If it doesn't, try restarting SSP.</p>
		
		<p>If the catgirl will not install any ghosts for you, you can unzip the .nar file and drag the contents into the \SSP\ghost folder. Your unzipped folder should have subfolders called 'ghost' and 'shell' on the top level, if it doesn't you'll have to move all the ghost's files up one level. Once that's done, restart SSP and look in the right click menu again, and they should be in your list of ghosts.</p>
		
		<p>Instructions on how to use each ghost are in their readmes, which should automatically pop up when you install them! If it doesn't appear, you can see it by opening them, right clicking on them, and going to Information>Read me.</p>
		
		<p>The right click menu is how you do things like change ghosts or call more of them at once, how you change the size of the ghost/balloon, and how you access the preferences menu to do things like make the ghost always stay on top of other windows. If you're wanting to tweak something about SSP, you'll likely find it there!</p>
