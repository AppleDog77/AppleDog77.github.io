        <p>This is my wonderful ghost that I put lots of time and effort into! It features the character The Narrator from one of my favorite games of all time, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1703340/The_Stanley_Parable_Ultra_Deluxe/">The Stanley Parable</a>.</p>
        <p>The Narrator rambles and blabs on your screen and you can pet him on their head and face (by dragging the mouse along his head, or using the mouse wheel). He's not very comfortable with pets at first, though... Don't hit him or else he- Why did I get cut off? Nevermind, anyway you can also double click his buttons for fun. He goes by he/they pronouns.</p>

        <p>If you double click anywhere else on The Narrator, a menu appears which you can use to give 'em gifts, hear what's on his mind currently, hear the last thing they said, ask him questions, have them ask you a question, play some games with him (in Do some stuff), have them insult you, vent at him, or ask about his life.</p>

        <p>There may or may not be a relationship (and mood) level thing as well... ;)</p>

        <p>This is a more complex ghost, with a plot (sort of) involving Stanley, and a relationship and mood level, so if you'd prefer a simpler ghost, check out <a href="../pprd/index.html">Pinkie Pie and Rainbow Dash</a>, or <a href="../homer/index.html">Homer Simpson</a>. <a href="../toy/index.html">Also check out ButtonToy</a>, <a href="../galaxy/index.html">Galaxy Buterfly</a>,  and <a href="../bucket/index.html">Reassurance Bucket</a>!

        <h1 id="faq">What's an Ukagaka/ghost?</h1>
		<p>An Ukagaka, or ghost, is a character that hangs out on your desktop! They can do little tasks for you such as emptying your recycling bin, checking for new emails, or checking the weather. Mostly they'll just keep you company and say random dialogue.</p>
		
		<p>Ghosts are very diverse, some have a strong focus on story and discovering information, while others are full of interesting functions or games. Check out this video to learn more!</p>

		<h1 id="faq">How to install a ghost</h1>
        <p>To use a ghost, you'll need a program to run it in. If you're on Windows, you can use <a href="http://ssp.shillest.net/">SSP</a>. If you're not on a Windows computer there are some options available, but you'll have to play around and see what works for you.</p><p>Mac: <a href="https://www14.big.or.jp/~ayase/ese/">Ukagaka on Macs</a>, <a href="http://ccm.sherry.jp/ninni/index.en.html">NiseRingo</a>, <a href="http://tablesalt.o0o0.jp/ukagaka/ct_maconssp.html">PlayonMac+SSP</a>, <a href="https://winebottler.kronenberg.org/">WineBottler</a><br>Linux: <a href="http://ninix-aya.osdn.jp/">NINIX-AYA</a></p>

        <p>For me (OdieDogXP), SSP works almost perfectly on my Arch Linux installation with Wine, with the only caveats being that installing ghosts basically doesn't work unless the file doesn't look <a href="img/UnzipNarLinux.png" target="blank">like this</a> on the inside, or is a simple zip file, and that ghosts only play sound if it's an MP3 file, even with LAV Filters installed.</p>

        <p>For those using SSP, go ahead and download the complete install package from the website. When you run it a catgirl named Emily should appear and say something in japanese. Drag and drop the .nar file you downloaded for this ghost on her, and she should install them for you. Once she's done, right click her, hover over 'change ghost', and select the appropriate ghost!</p>
		
        <p>If you get an error window <a href="img/error_nothing_in_directory.png" target="blank">like this</a> when you start SSP, it probably can't find any ghosts to run. You can try dropping the .nar file for the ghost you want to install onto that window. If that doesn't work, click the first button and point it towards your ghost directory (it should be \SSP\ghost).</p>
		
		<p>If the right click menu is in Japanese, the language option is the 4th one up from the bottom. Select English and it should change immediately. If it doesn't, try restarting SSP.</p>
		
		<p>If the catgirl will not install any ghosts for you, you can unzip the .nar file and drag the contents into the \SSP\ghost folder. Your unzipped folder should have subfolders called 'ghost' and 'shell' on the top level, if it doesn't you'll have to move all the ghost's files up one level. Once that's done, restart SSP and look in the right click menu again, and they should be in your list of ghosts.</p>
		
		<p>Instructions on how to use each ghost are in their readmes, which should automatically pop up when you install them! If it doesn't appear, you can see it by opening them, right clicking on them, and going to Information>Read me.</p>
		
		<p>The right click menu is how you do things like change ghosts or call more of them at once, how you change the size of the ghost/balloon, and how you access the preferences menu to do things like make the ghost always stay on top of other windows. If you're wanting to tweak something about SSP, you'll likely find it there!</p>
