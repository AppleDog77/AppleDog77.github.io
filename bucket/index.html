        <p>This is my wonderful Hydrate shell that I put lots of time and effort into for <a href="https://ukagakadreamteam.com/wiki/event/8_20_hydrate_shell_jam_2023">Hydrate Shell Jam 2023</a>! It features the Reassurance Bucket from one of my favorite games of all time, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1703340/The_Stanley_Parable_Ultra_Deluxe/">The Stanley Parable</a>.</p>
        <p>It reassures you, calms you down and keeps you hydrated. Comes with cute little stickers!</p>

        <h1 id="faq">What's an Ukagaka/ghost?</h1>
		<p>An Ukagaka, or ghost, is a character that hangs out on your desktop! They can do little tasks for you such as emptying your recycling bin, checking for new emails, or checking the weather. Mostly they'll just keep you company and say random dialogue.</p>
		
		<p>Ghosts are very diverse, some have a strong focus on story and discovering information, while others are full of interesting functions or games. Check out this video to learn more!</p>

		<h1 id="faq">How to install a ghost</h1>
        <p>To use a ghost, you'll need a program to run it in. If you're on Windows, you can use <a href="http://ssp.shillest.net/">SSP</a>. If you're not on a Windows computer there are some options available, but you'll have to play around and see what works for you.</p><p>Mac: <a href="https://www14.big.or.jp/~ayase/ese/">Ukagaka on Macs</a>, <a href="http://ccm.sherry.jp/ninni/index.en.html">NiseRingo</a>, <a href="http://tablesalt.o0o0.jp/ukagaka/ct_maconssp.html">PlayonMac+SSP</a>, <a href="https://winebottler.kronenberg.org/">WineBottler</a><br>Linux: <a href="http://ninix-aya.osdn.jp/">NINIX-AYA</a></p>

        <p><strong>Note:</strong> For me (OdieDogXP), SSP works almost perfectly on my Arch Linux installation with Wine, with the only caveats being that SSP 2.6.98 and below work well without Steam (albeit with graphical glitches which aren't there in Steam), but 2.7.00 and higher require Steam with Proton. Add SSP as a non-Steam game, and in the settings, uncheck the Steam overlay and set the compatibility layer to Proton 9.0-4. There are problems with dragging ghosts and balloons around, some lag (more lag when more ghosts are on screen), and you have to, using Windows (I dual-boot it with Arch Linux), turn off Window Title detectors in some ghosts (that use Findwin.dll) or it'll crash, but that's all the issues.</p>

        <p>If you get an error window <a href="img/error_nothing_in_directory.png" target="blank">like this</a> when you start SSP, it probably can't find any ghosts to run. You can try dropping the .nar file for the ghost you want to install onto that window. If that doesn't work, click the first button and point it towards your ghost directory (it should be \SSP\ghost).</p>
		
		<p>If the right click menu is in Japanese, the language option is the 4th one up from the bottom. Select English and it should change immediately. If it doesn't, try restarting SSP.</p>
		
		<p>If the catgirl will not install any ghosts for you, you can unzip the .nar file and drag the contents into the \SSP\ghost folder. Your unzipped folder should have subfolders called 'ghost' and 'shell' on the top level, if it doesn't you'll have to move all the ghost's files up one level. Once that's done, restart SSP and look in the right click menu again, and they should be in your list of ghosts.</p>
		
		<p>Instructions on how to use each ghost are in their readmes, which should automatically pop up when you install them! If it doesn't appear, you can see it by opening them, right clicking on them, and going to Information>Read me.</p>
		
		<p>The right click menu is how you do things like change ghosts or call more of them at once, how you change the size of the ghost/balloon, and how you access the preferences menu to do things like make the ghost always stay on top of other windows. If you're wanting to tweak something about SSP, you'll likely find it there!</p>
